# NLP project--Physics Today Survey Response Analytics
When working at American Institute of Physics, I led a text mining project to analyze  readers' feedback of our flagship magazine, Physics Today to extract the common themes our readers talking about, identify customer preferences and customer demographics. A series of text preprocessing techniques, Hierarchical Clustering with cosine similarity as the distance matrix and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) were mainly used in this project.  

We were mainly intersted in 
1. What our readers like most about Physics Today;
2. What our readers like least about Physics Today;
3. What other sources readers refer to besides Physics Today;
4. What topics our readers are interested in.

The methodology, findings and conclusions were all included in the report.
